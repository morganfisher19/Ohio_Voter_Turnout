"1In  some instances the citizen voting-age estimates by race were not available from the source table S2901 due in part to small sample sizes and  the very small percentage of noncitizens for these groups.  To provide more information about the voting population for the missing cells, this table includes some estimates of the voting-age population from the B01001 table series which does not show estimates of citizens and noncitizens.  This occurred for the following races: Blacks (72 cells), American Indian and Alaska Native (66 cells), and Two or more races (164 cells).  On average, citizens make up 97% of the total population across these cells. The cells using the total voting-age population instead of the citizen voting-age population are shown in italics blue font.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
